Hi, I'm Michael Beavers. 
My background is in Industrial Automation and Controls, with some various programming thrown in for good measure.
I'm currently the Department Chair of the Technology,  Lake Land College in Mattoon, Il.<br>

I'm currently working on the:

[Prompt project.](/prompt.ipynb)
The goal of this project is to use what I know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.<p>
  <b><span>&#8226;</span> Section 1:</b> The null hypothosis "There will be no difference in coupon acceptance between drivers over 25 who go to a bar more than once a month and all drivers over 25" is rejected.<p>
  Ttest_indResult(statistic=-6.534880112360552, pvalue=7.657885459445587e-11)<br>
  For the age group >26 <36 , 789 rejected the coupon and 279 accepted for 0.2612359550561798 acceptance rate<br>
  For the age group >21 <31 , 917 rejected the coupon and 571 accepted for 0.38373655913978494 acceptance rate<p>
  
<b><span>&#8226;</span> Section 2:</b> The null hypothosis "There will be no difference in coupon acceptance between all drivers and those drivers who go to bars more    than once a month,  and had passengers that were not a kid, and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry" is rejected.<p>
  For the test group, 1393 rejected the coupon and 2303 accepted for 0.6231060606060606 acceptance rate<br>
  For the total population, 5394 rejected the coupon and 7095 accepted for 0.5680999279365841 acceptance rate<p>

  Ttest_indResult(statistic=5.959225082368148, pvalue=2.5869554306308568e-09)<p>

<b><span>&#8226;</span> Section 3:</b> The null hypothosis "There will be no difference in coupon acceptance between all drivers and those drivers who go to bars more   than once a month,  go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month, and income is less than 50K." is not rejected.<p>
  For the test group, 184 rejected the coupon and 155 accepted for 0.45722713864306785 acceptance rate<br>
  For the population group, 1170 rejected the coupon and 812 accepted for 0.40968718466195764 acceptance rate<p>

Ttest_indResult(statistic=1.6409306442988119, pvalue=0.10094742165958862)<p>
  
<b><span>&#8226;</span>Section 4:</b> The null hypothosis: There will be no difference in coupon acceptance between drivers who were offered cheaper restaurant     coupons, visited cheaper restaurants 1-3 times a month, and the weather was sunny and 80 and all other drivers who were offered cheaper restaurant coupons and visited  cheaper restaurants 1-3 times a month is not rejected.<p>
  For the test group, 158 rejected the coupon and 482 accepted for 0.753125 acceptance rate<br>
  For the population group, 339 rejected the coupon and 807 accepted for 0.7041884816753927 acceptance rate<p>
  
  Ttest_indResult(statistic=2.214645955102566, pvalue=0.02691033216326842)<p>
